# RL-Glue Project Extensions #
This project contains all of the source code and downloads for the RL-Glue Codecs.

Codecs are extensions to RL-Glue that use sockets so that agents/environments/experiments can be written in languages like Matlab, Python, Java, Lisp, and C/C++.  Remember that you cannot use the codecs until you have the RL-Glue Core project installed.

The RL-Glue Core project project is also available for download through this project.  We keep the download all together for your convenience.
